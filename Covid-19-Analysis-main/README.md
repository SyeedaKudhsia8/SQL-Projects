Sure! Here's a detailed, well-structured `README.md` tailored for your **COVID-19 India Analysis** project, assuming you've done basic cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📊 COVID-19 India Analysis & Visualization

A comprehensive analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data from India. This project leverages **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** and **Google Colab** to clean, engineer, and explore key insights from the COVID-19 dataset.

---

### 📁 Dataset

**Name**: `covid_19_india.csv`  

**Features (columns)** may include:
- `Date`
- `State/UnionTerritory`
- `ConfirmedIndianNational`
- `ConfirmedForeignNational`
- `Cured`
- `Deaths`
- `Confirmed`
- `State_code` (optional)
- `Active Cases` (engineered)
- `Daily Cases` (engineered)
- `Month`, `Weekday` (engineered)

### 🧼 1. Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values in `Confirmed`, `Cured`, and `Deaths`.
- Converted `Date` column to datetime format.
- Standardized column names for ease of use.
- Filtered unnecessary columns like `ConfirmedIndianNational` if mostly empty.

---

### 🏗️ 2. Feature Engineering

Created new features to enhance the dataset:
- `Active Cases = Confirmed - (Cured + Deaths)`
- `Daily Confirmed`: Grouped by date to calculate new cases daily.
- `Month` and `Weekday`: Extracted from the date for trend analysis.

---

### 📊 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 🧠 National Trends
- Line plot of total confirmed, active, cured, and death cases over time.
- Growth curve of daily new cases.

#### 📍 State-wise Analysis
- Top 10 states by confirmed and active cases.
- Heatmap of state-wise cases.

#### 📅 Temporal Patterns
- Monthly trend of confirmed cases.
- Day-of-week analysis: e.g., Are cases lower on weekends?

#### 📈 Correlation
- Scatter plot between total confirmed and deaths.
- Pairplots or correlation heatmap if relevant.

#### 📌 Additional Insights
- Death rate (`Deaths / Confirmed`)
- Recovery rate (`Cured / Confirmed`)
- States with unusual spikes
